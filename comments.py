# => We add comments to our code using the symbol #

# This is a comment in my code — it does nothing.
# Lines that start with # are ignored by Python.

# Example: commenting out code means it won't run
# print('Hello world')
# print("Hello world")
# No output will be displayed from the above lines!

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# => Comments can explain the purpose of certain code
# Enable PIN check as listed in security requirements
# (Here it’s just an example function call, not actual working code)
# enable_pin(current_user, pin) # this is disable now

# => Comments can explain tricky parts of code
# Using double quotes for this string because it contains a single quote
print("It's a small world after all")

# => Commenting out lines can help in debugging
print('Hello world')                # This will run
# print('It's a small world after all')   # This is disabled for now
